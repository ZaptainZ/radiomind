# Log Writing Rules

`projectBasicInfo/logs/` stores important implementation plans and outcome records.

## When to Write

- **When starting a major plan**: Write a planning doc with goals, approach, and affected files
- **After completing a major plan**: Write an outcome doc with what was done, issues encountered, and final approach
- **When the user requests it**: Follow this rule when prompted

## Naming Format

`YYYY-MM-DD-english-topic-<role>.md`

`<role>` identifies the author so future readers can trace who wrote each log. **Pick the suffix that matches who you are — do not default to `cc` regardless of identity.**

| If you are | Use suffix |
|------------|------------|
| Claude Code | `cc` |
| Codex | `codex` |
| Other AI agent | the agent's short name (e.g. `cursor`, `aider`) |
| Human author | your initials or short name (e.g. `zt`, `alex`) |

Examples:
- `2026-02-08-auth-system-design-cc.md` (written by Claude Code)
- `2026-02-08-deploy-rollback-codex.md` (written by Codex)
- `2026-02-08-perf-investigation-zt.md` (written by a human, initials `zt`)

## Principles

- Logs are **implementation records**, not project documentation. Project docs go in `projectBasicInfo/` main directory
- One plan = one log file (if planning and outcome are separate, use same date with different suffixes)
- Content includes: background, goals, approach, modified files, issues encountered, conclusions
- Agent should proactively write at the start and end of major work, without waiting for user prompts
